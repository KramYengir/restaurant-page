The purpose of this assignment was to put to practice what I've learned about the modular approach, npm, webpack and building the webpage purely from Javascript via DOM manipulation.

### What I've learned...
- Setting up the webpack environment
- An understanding of important webpack elements; entry, output, devServer, loaders, plugins...
- An understanding of the webpack config file and the implementation of webpack elements i.e. loaders, plugins etc.
- Using HTML templates via the HtmlWebpackPlugin
- The use of custom scripts via package.json
- Using Sass for the first time
- How to implement the Google Maps API
- Structuring and iterating over large amounts of text - *for the menu*
- Creating an animated hamburger menu via CSS

### Where I need improvement...
- A better understanding and adherence to the SOLID principles when organizing my code
- Furthermore, how to better seperate my code into DOM, Events and Logic concerns
- To recognize when best to use Classes, Objects, IIFEs, Factory Functions...
- A better understanding of color theory when it comes to the design
- Get more comfortable with Git, specifically the use of branches
